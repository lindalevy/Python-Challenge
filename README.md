# Python-Challenge

# created for week 3 homework
# 

PYBank
# code finished, written to use dictionary and lists

pyPoll
# code finally finished
# I ended up using lists and dict
# the dict was a great way to sum the values by a candidate
# but then I changed the dict out to lists (one for candidate and one for values)
# this then allowed me to calculate on the values list and produce a third list of the percentages

# I could have zipped these three lists all back together, but chose not to
# having three seperate lists allowed me greater control over the output (spacing mainly)
